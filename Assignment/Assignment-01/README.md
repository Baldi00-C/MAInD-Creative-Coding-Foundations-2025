# ADHD Out of the Chat! - Micro App

## Brief
Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to coustomize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

## Overview
This is a simple web app designed to help you organize tasks, ideas, and small reminders in a clean and minimal interface.  
It works like a personal brain dump, taking the chaos out of your mind and putting it into a simple checklist.

The app consists of **three main sections**:

1. **What is?** – Explains the purpose of the app and how it can help you manage small tasks and ideas.  
2. **How use it?** – Gives a short guide on how to use the app, with tips on adding, flagging, and deleting tasks.  
3. **Use it!** – The interactive section where you can:
   - Add new tasks to your list.
   - Delete tasks that you completed.
   - Check/uncheck tasks to track progress.

## Features
- **Tabbed sections**: Only one section is visible at a time. Clicking a tab button shows the related section.
- **Interactive task list**:
  - Add tasks using the input field and “+” button.
  - Delete checked tasks using the trash button.
  - Tasks are displayed with checkboxes.
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop with a simple layout.
- **Custom styles**: Uses Google Fonts (Raleway & Bad Script) and a color-coded interface for clarity.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the page and content.
- **CSS** – Styling of buttons, sections, input fields, and checkboxes.
- **JavaScript** – Tab switching, adding/deleting list items, and checkbox interactions.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click on the tabs to switch between sections.
3. In the “Use it!” section:
   - Type a task in the input field.
   - Click the `+` button to add it to the list.
   - Check the box when the task is done.
   - Click the trash button to remove all checked tasks.

## Notes
- Each checkbox can be styled and customized through CSS.
- The “active” tab button changes style to show which section is visible.
- This project is beginner-friendly and a good way to practice **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** basics.
